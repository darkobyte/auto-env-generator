# For generating .env.example files (empty templates):
# output = ".env.example"
# merge_existing = false

# For production environments (preserve all existing values):
# output = ".env.production"
# merge_existing = true

# For development with minimal variables:
# ignore = ["HOME", "PATH", "USER", "DEBUG", "TEST_*"]
